> [TIP]
> If you are looking for the full roadmap, including this project, go back to the [getting started](https://devopsroadmap.io/getting-started) page.

This repository is the starting point for [HiveBox](https://devopsroadmap.io/projects/hivebox/), the end-to-end hands-on project.

You can fork this repository and start implementing the [HiveBox](https://devopsroadmap.io/projects/hivebox/) project. HiveBox project follows the same Dynamic MVP-style mindset used in the [roadmap](https://devopsroadmap.io/).

The project aims to cover the whole Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). That means each phase will cover all aspects of DevOps, such as planning, coding, containers, testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure, etc.

Happy DevOpsing ♾️

# HiveBox - DevOps End-to-End Hands-On Project

## Phase 1: Kickoff and Preparation

### Overview
In **Phase 1**, I focused on laying the groundwork for the HiveBox project. This phase includes understanding my role in the project, setting up the Kanban board, and structuring the repository for the upcoming work in the project. 

### Key Activities in Phase 1
1. **Kickoff:**
   - Decide which Agile methodology you will use, such as Scrum, Kanban, or Scrumban
   
2. **Preparation:**
   - Fork the HiveBox repository.
   - Set up a Kanban project board on GitHub to manage tasks.
   - Each phase should be presented as a pull request against the main branch. 
   - Document as you go. 
   - Get senseBox IDs by checking the openSenseMap website. Use 3 senseBox IDs close to each other. Copy the IDs, you will need them in the next steps.

### Steps Taken
- Chose **Kanban** as the Agile methodology for its flexibility and visual approach to task management. 
  
- **Kanban Setup:**
   - Created the **Kanban board** on GitHub Projects with **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Completed** columns.
   - Named the project `Hivebox Devops Workflow`.
   - Ensured the board structure aligns with project needs (tasks, progress tracking).
   
- **Repository Setup:**
   - Forked the **HiveBox** repo and cloned it to my local machine.
   - Created a branch (`phase1-setup`) for this phase.
   - Kept this branch focused on setup and initial documentation.

- **PR Workflow**:
  - Created a pull request for the README update to ensure that changes were reviewed before being merged into the main branch.

- Identified **3 senseBox IDs** for use in later phases of the project:

  `5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786`

  `5c21ff8f919bf8001adf2488`

  `5ade1acf223bd80019a1011c`

---  

### Next Steps
- In **Phase 2**, I will start implementing core functionality.
- As I move into the next phases, I will continue adding documentation in this format for clarity and better tracking of progress.
